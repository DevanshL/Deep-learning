## Introduction

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a class of machine learning frameworks designed by Goodfellow et al. in 2014. A GAN consists of two networks, a generator and a discriminator, which contest with each other in a zero-sum game. The generator tries to produce realistic images, while the discriminator attempts to distinguish between real and fake images.

This project implements:
- A simple GAN using the Dogs and Cats dataset.
- A Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN) using an Anime dataset.

## Datasets

### Dogs and Cats Dataset
- The dataset contains images of dogs and cats.
- Used for training the simple GAN.

### Anime Dataset
- The dataset contains images of anime characters.
- Used for training the DCGAN.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch 1.6.0+

## Models

#### Simple GAN
The simple GAN consists of:

A Generator: Uses Linear and LeakyReLU layers to generate images from random noise.
A Discriminator: Uses Linear and LeakyReLU layers to distinguish between real and fake images.
DCGAN
The DCGAN consists of:

A Generator: Uses ConvTranspose2d and LeakyReLU layers to generate images from random noise.
A Discriminator: Uses Conv2d and LeakyReLU layers to distinguish between real and fake images.
Training
Both models are trained using the following approach:

- Generate Noise: Create random noise as input for the generator.
- Generate Images: Use the generator to create fake images from the noise.
- Discriminate Images: Use the discriminator to classify real and fake images.
- Calculate Losses: Compute the loss for both generator and discriminator.
- Update Models: Use backpropagation to update the weights of both models.

## Training Steps

The training is performed over several epochs.
The generator and discriminator are updated iteratively.
The losses and accuracies are tracked and displayed.

## Results

- Simple GAN
- Generates realistic images of dogs and cats.
- The generated images improve as training progresses.

#### DCGAN

- Generates high-quality anime images.
- Utilizes convolutional layers to capture complex patterns in the data.
- Example Generated Images
- Below are example images generated by the models during training:
