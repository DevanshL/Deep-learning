# Vision Transformer (ViT)

![Vision Transformer](https://github.com/DevanshL/Deep-learning/blob/main/Vit/Image/Vit.jpeg)

This repository contains code and resources for working with Vision Transformers (ViT), a type of transformer architecture specifically designed for computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation.

## Contents

- `going_modular/`: Contains files related to modular implementation of Vision Transformers.
- `kaggle.json`: A JSON file likely containing API credentials for Kaggle.
- `vit-pretrained.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook for working with pre-trained Vision Transformer models.
- `vit_scratch.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook for training a Vision Transformer model from scratch.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/vision-transformer.git
    cd vision-transformer
    ```

2. **Install the required dependencies.** It's recommended to use a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Obtain the necessary data for training or evaluation.** You can find various publicly available datasets suitable for computer vision tasks on platforms like Kaggle or TensorFlow Datasets. For this project, we've included a dataset link: [Dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19dRMuuGBtguy2JAtmF7JxEE2Mnq241iy)

4. **Open the Jupyter Notebooks** (`vit-pretrained.ipynb` or `vit_scratch.ipynb`) and follow the instructions inside to work with pre-trained models or train a Vision Transformer model from scratch, respectively.

## Vision Transformer (ViT) Overview

Vision Transformers are an innovative architecture that utilizes transformers, a model initially designed for natural language processing, to handle image data. This method divides an image into patches, processes these patches as sequences, and applies transformer encoders to extract features, achieving high performance in various vision tasks.

## Training

To train the Vision Transformer model from scratch, use the following command:

``` bash
python train.py --config configs/vit_config.json
```
This command will start the training process using the configurations specified in configs/vit_config.json.

## Evaluation
To evaluate the trained model, use the following command:

``` python evaluate.py --config configs/vit_config.json --checkpoint path/to/checkpoint.pth
```
