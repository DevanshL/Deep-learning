# Stock Price Prediction using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)

## Part 1 - Data Preprocessing

### Feature Scaling

In this section, we normalize or scale the features to ensure consistent and effective training for the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN).

### Creating a data structure with 60 timesteps and 1 output

Organize the dataset into sequences with 60 timesteps, preparing the data for training the RNN.

## Part 2 - Building and Training the RNN

### Importing the Keras libraries and packages

Introduce the Keras libraries and packages used for constructing the RNN model.

### Initializing the RNN

Set up the architecture of the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that will be used for stock price prediction.

### Adding LSTM layers with Dropout regularization

Detail the addition of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers, along with Dropout regularization, to the RNN architecture.

### Adding the output layer

Specify the output layer of the RNN, which is responsible for making predictions based on the learned patterns.

### Compiling the RNN

Explain the compilation step, including the choice of optimizer and loss function for training the RNN.

### Fitting the RNN to the Training set

Describe the process of training the RNN on the prepared training set.

## Part 3 - Making Predictions and Visualizing the Results

### Getting the real stock price of 2017

Outline the steps to obtain the real stock prices for the year 2017, which will be used for model evaluation.

### Getting the predicted stock price of 2017

Explain the process of making predictions using the trained RNN model and obtaining the predicted stock prices.

### Visualizing the results

Discuss the visualization of both real and predicted stock prices to assess the performance of the RNN model.
