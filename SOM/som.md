# Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) for Fraud Detection

## Overview
This project utilizes Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) for fraud detection, a technique from unsupervised machine learning. SOMs are artificial neural networks that can be effective in identifying patterns and anomalies in high-dimensional data.

## Getting Started

#### Prerequisites
* Python (>=3.6)
* Libraries: minisom, numpy, pandas, sklearn.

## Importing the Dataset
Start by importing the dataset that contains relevant information for fraud detection. Ensure the dataset is well-structured and includes necessary features.

## Feature Scaling
Feature scaling is a critical step for training the SOM. Normalize the features to ensure the convergence of the SOM algorithm.

## Visualizing the Results
Visualize the trained SOM to understand how data points are clustered. Visualization aids in identifying patterns and potential anomalies.

## Finding Fraud Cases
Utilize the trained SOM to identify potential fraud cases based on the clustering of data points. Examine clusters or outliers that may represent fraudulent behavior.

## Conclusion
Summarize the effectiveness of using Self-Organizing Maps for fraud detection. Discuss any challenges encountered and potential improvements for future work.
